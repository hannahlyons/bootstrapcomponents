        On August 15, 1998—20 years ago—the<i> iMac</i> first went on sale. Since its introduction, the<i> iMac</i> has gone through seven different design iterations as it progressed from various colors, shapes, and sizes to the streamlined profile we know today through a variety of materials. The<i> iMac </i> generated a stir when it was first released and went on to become a design classic. in honor of the all-in-one computer's 20th anniversary. Being the first Macintosh computer to have a USB connector, the original <i>iMac</i> popularized USB. The floppy drive was also destroyed. On August 15, 1998, Apple began shipping the first <i>iMac</i>, which had a 233HMz PowerPC G3 processor, 32MB of RAM, a 4GB hard drive, and a 15-inch display. Costing $1,299, it. The first generation of Apple's<i> iMac </i> was available in a range of colors, including Bondi Blue, Lime, Strawberry, Blueberry, Grape, Tangerine, and later Blue Dalmatian and Flower Power, in contrast to the rest of the PC market, which at the time tended to be beige. It was Apple's first I device, and the "I" in <i>iMac</i> stands for internet. In 1998, as the internet grew quickly, the first internet weblogs started to emerge. An advertising from the time claimed that Apple advertised the <i>iMac</i> as a simple, two-step process for connecting to the internet. The I prefix was adopted by Apple for many of its consumer product lines, including iPod, iPhone, iPad, iLife, iWork, and iTunes.
